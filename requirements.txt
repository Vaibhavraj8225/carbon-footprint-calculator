ðŸ§© Step 1: Requirements

To run your project, the computer needs:

Node.js & npm

Node.js is the runtime for your backend and frontend.

npm (Node Package Manager) comes with Node.js.

Download & install from: https://nodejs.org

Verify installation:

node -v
npm -v


Git (optional but recommended)

To clone your repository from GitHub.

Download: https://git-scm.com

ðŸ§© Step 2: Clone the Repository

Open PowerShell / Terminal and run:

git clone https://github.com/Vaibhavraj8225/carbon-footprint-calculator.git
cd carbon-footprint-calculator


This downloads all your project files.

Alternatively, you can download ZIP from GitHub and extract it.

ðŸ§© Step 3: Install Dependencies

Your project has two parts: backend and frontend. Both need their dependencies installed.

3.1 Backend
cd backend
npm install


This installs all Node.js packages needed for the backend (express, cors, pdfkit, etc.).

3.2 Frontend

Open another terminal or go back to root:

cd ../frontend
npm install


This installs all frontend packages (react, axios, recharts, etc.).

ðŸ§© Step 4: Run the Project

You need both backend and frontend running at the same time.

4.1 Start Backend
cd backend
node server.js


You should see:

âœ… Server running on http://localhost:5000

4.2 Start Frontend

In a new terminal:

cd frontend
npm start


This will open the React app in your browser at:

http://localhost:3000
